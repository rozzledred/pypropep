# pypropep
"Computation of complex chemical equilibria of a perfect gas and pure condensed species in order to characterize rocket motor performance. This software intend to be a replacement of the highly useful propep while allowing more flexibility.

The thermochemical data were provided by Bonnie McBride of NASA Gleen Research Center."

This is the original description for the C implementation of the ProPep program. This program has been through multiple iterations in multiple languages, starting all the way back as a DOS program.
This project is an attempt at remaking the program in a modern language, Python.
